# MedicationTracker


This app is designed for people who need to take a lot of
different medications everyday (f.ex chronically ill people). You enter your
treatment plan through the settings and the app will then keep track of every medication and
how many days it will still last, updating it automatically every day. This makes it easier to know 
when to go to the pharmacy, to restock on your medication. The app works completely offline so no internet
connection is required.

You can swipe through the different months on the calendar.
Every colored point corresponds to the day where that specific medication will
run out.
